    <h1>Formative experiences</h1>
    <p>My experiences are varied and I believe a strong foundation from a young age
    where I was given the opportunity to organise, manage and lead large events and organisations has helped form me to who I am today. </p>
    <p>So while some might not consider these to be "Professional Experiences", these are some experiences that give a better sense of my formative years
      and I feel are worth sharing.</p>
